# Bench-verify registry

Phase 1 was authored **without a live Frappe bench**. Every assumption that
depends on the real UCC system is listed here and also carries an inline
`TODO: bench-verify` token. Find them all with:

```bash
grep -rn "TODO: bench-verify" frappe-app/
```

The bench-connected (OrbStack) session must resolve each before install/migrate.

## Global

| # | Assumption | Where | Action on bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Target Frappe version is **v15** | `hooks.py`, all DocType JSON | Confirm version; adjust JSON keys / controller hooks if v14/v13 |
| 2 | Install path is `frappe-app/ucc_measurement_outcomes` | `README.md` | `bench get-app <path>` then `install-app` on a **dev** site only |
| 3 | Permissions are **System Manager only** | every DocType JSON `permissions` | Add real `Survey Manager` / `Survey Author` roles + rules (fixtures) |

## External DocType references (deliberately NOT hard-linked)

Per scope lock, these are plain `Data` fields, not `Link`s, until confirmed:

| # | Field | DocType JSON | Real target to confirm |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | `owner_department` | `ucc_survey` | Real Department / Cost Center DocType name + key field |

Core Frappe DocTypes are safe to link and **are** linked: `User`
(`ucc_survey_version.published_by`).

## Snapshot completeness

| # | Assumption | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | Publish snapshot freezes title + description only | `ucc_survey_version.py before_save` — extend if the reporting layer needs more survey-level fields frozen |

## Not yet built (later checkpoints, not assumptions)

- Builder Desk Page UI (Phase 1, checkpoint 2)
- Campaign / Submission / Answer + guest endpoint (checkpoint 3)
- Mapping + Metric DocTypes and node canvas (checkpoint 4)
- Index DocTypes, scoring/normalisation, results (checkpoint 5)
