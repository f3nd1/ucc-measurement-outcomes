# Bench-verify registry

Phase 1 was authored **without a live Frappe bench**. Every assumption that
depends on the real UCC system is listed here and also carries an inline
`TODO: bench-verify` token. Find them all with:

```bash
grep -rn "TODO: bench-verify" frappe-app/
```

The bench-connected (OrbStack) session must resolve each before install/migrate.

## Global

| # | Assumption | Where | Action on bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Target Frappe version is **v15** | `hooks.py`, all DocType JSON | Confirm version; adjust JSON keys / controller hooks if v14/v13 |
| 2 | Install path is `frappe-app/ucc_measurement_outcomes` | `README.md` | `bench get-app <path>` then `install-app` on a **dev** site only |
| 3 | Permissions are **System Manager only** | every DocType JSON `permissions` | Add real `Survey Manager` / `Survey Author` roles + rules (fixtures) |

## External DocType references (deliberately NOT hard-linked)

Per scope lock, these are plain `Data` fields, not `Link`s, until confirmed:

| # | Field | DocType JSON | Real target to confirm |
|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | `owner_department` | `ucc_survey` | Real Department / Cost Center DocType name + key field |

Core Frappe DocTypes are safe to link and **are** linked: `User`
(`ucc_survey_version.published_by`).

## Snapshot completeness

| # | Assumption | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | Publish snapshot freezes title + description only | `ucc_survey_version.py before_save` — extend if the reporting layer needs more survey-level fields frozen |

## Builder Desk Page (checkpoint 2)

| # | Assumption | Where | Action on bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | Page role access is System Manager only | `page/survey_builder/survey_builder.json` | Add real Survey roles alongside DocType perms |
| 7 | Choices are edited as `label\|value` lines in the inspector | `survey_builder.js` `_apply` | Confirm this is enough, or build a grid editor if matrix/ranking need richer choices |
| 8 | Reorder does N per-question saves | `api/builder.py reorder_questions` | Fine now; batch if surveys reach hundreds of questions |

Manual smoke test once installed: open a Draft version in the builder, drag a
type in, reorder, edit via inspector, then publish the version and confirm the
builder shows the read-only banner and blocks edits.

## Campaign + public submission (checkpoint 3)

| # | Assumption | Where | Action on bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | `frappe.rate_limit(key="token", limit=20, seconds=3600)` | `api/public.py` | Confirm the decorator signature on the target Frappe version + agree real limits with UCC (per-token and per-IP) |
| 10 | Storing `respondent_ip` is acceptable | `ucc_survey_submission.json`, `api/public.py` | Confirm PDPA/retention; drop or hash if not permitted |
| 11 | One-response enforcement keys on `respondent_key` only | `api/public.py submit_survey` | When Secure-Token invitations land, derive the key from the invitation; decide IP fallback for pure-anonymous |
| 12 | Multi-select answers stored comma-joined in one row | `submission_utils.to_text` | Confirm per-option breakdown can be parsed later, or split into rows if needed |
| 13 | Guest writes use `ignore_permissions=True` inside the endpoint | `api/public.py` | Intended trust-boundary pattern; confirm no guest role is granted on the DocTypes themselves |

Not built yet in this checkpoint (natural next small piece): the public-facing
web page (portal/`www` route) that renders `get_public_survey` and POSTs to
`submit_survey`. The endpoint + data model are complete and testable via
`frappe.call` without it.

Manual smoke test once installed: publish a version, open a campaign, hit
`get_public_survey`/`submit_survey` as Guest, confirm one Submission + one
Answer row per question and that a second submit with the same respondent_key
is rejected.

## Mapping + Metric shell (checkpoint 4)

| # | Assumption | Where | Action on bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | Objective/metric codes are invented placeholders | `ucc_objective`, `ucc_metric_definition` | Import real codes from the existing Survey Objective-Question Mapping instead of hand-entering |
| 15 | Operational metric sources are `Data` paths (e.g. `Assessment Result.grade`) | `ucc_metric_source.source_reference`, `ucc_metric_result.entity` | Confirm real DocType/field paths, then decide Data vs Dynamic Link |
| 16 | Clauses are free-text codes on the mapping, no UCC Clause master | `ucc_question_mapping.primary_clause` | Confirm whether clauses need their own master DocType |
| 17 | Shared canvas loaded via `app_include_js` on every Desk page | `hooks.py`, `public/js/node_canvas.js` | Fine (defines one class); move to a page bundle if load cost matters |
| 18 | Metric mapping uses a `sources` child table (added beyond the listed 5 DocTypes) | `ucc_metric_source` | Confirm this models reusable metrics correctly; it keeps metric mapping separate from objective mapping as required |

Note: added **UCC Metric Source** (child of Metric Definition) beyond the five
listed DocTypes, so a reusable metric can span multiple questions/surveys.
Objective mapping (UCC Question Mapping) and metric mapping (Metric Definition
sources) stay separate records, per the standing decision.

Manual smoke test once installed: open Mapping Studio for a version, map a
question to an objective + clause, add it as a metric source, and confirm the
lineage renders on the shared canvas.

## Index shell + calculation engine (checkpoint 5)

| # | Assumption | Where | Action on bench |
|---|---|---|---|
| 19 | Metric values read as latest `UCC Metric Result` by metric/period/entity | `index_calc._load_metric_values` | Confirm entity resolution once real DocTypes are known |
| 20 | Calculation runs on the `short` queue | `api/index_studio.calculate` | Confirm worker/queue availability on the bench |
| 21 | `Count`/`Hours` normalisations pass through raw (not 0-100) | `index_engine.normalise` | Agree a scaling rule with UCC if counts/hours must feed a 0-100 index |
| 22 | Circular-reference detection not yet implemented | `api/index_studio.validate_index` | Add a cycle check before production (weights-total check is done) |

Immutability chain (satisfies "a formula edit must never silently change a
published score"): `UCC Index Version` freezes on publish (same rule as survey
versions, shared `versioning.py`); `UCC Index Result` rejects any post-insert
edit; results Link to the exact `index_version` used. Editing a formula ⇒ new
version ⇒ new results.

The scoring/normalisation math lives in the pure `index_engine.py` and is
unit-tested with fixture data (`test_index_engine.py`): a 3-level SEQI-shaped
tree with known inputs produces exactly 85, partial coverage re-bases weights,
and every normalisation rule is checked. `index_calc.py` only wires Frappe data
into it — no arithmetic in the DB layer.

Manual smoke test once installed: build an index version (index → dimensions →
metric nodes), validate weights=100, publish, seed a few `UCC Metric Result`
rows (or pass `metric_values`), calculate, and open the result's breakdown to
trace the score to each metric.

## Not yet built (future phases, not assumptions)

- Dashboard Studio + Data Explorer (native Frappe charts first)
- Public survey web page (portal route rendering `get_public_survey`)
- Quality Action / Quality Meeting integration (needs bench discovery of those DocTypes)
