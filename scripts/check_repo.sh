# Regression guard for the index-studio TypeError: Validate and Publish were
# live before any version had loaded, so frappe.call sent {} (it drops undefined
# args) and validate_index/publish_version raised a missing-argument TypeError.
# There is no JS test harness in this repo, so this asserts the guard is still
# in the source. It fails the moment someone removes it.
# python3, not grep: grep -F treats a newline in the pattern as a SECOND pattern
# (an OR), so a two-line "method + its guard" assertion silently passes on the
# method line alone. Found by deleting the guard and watching the check stay
# green - a check that cannot fail is worse than no check.
